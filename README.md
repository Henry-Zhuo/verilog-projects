# verilog-projects
A collection of small projects made using Verilog



## Testing

### Test benches

Test benches for modules can be run using `test.sh $MODULE_DIR` where `$MODULE_DIR` is the name of the folder holding the test bench and the modules to test. The test bench and all necessary modules must be in the same folder. An alternative is to run Verilog compiler and runtime engine manually.
